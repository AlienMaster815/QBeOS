# Overview
QBeOS is a hobby operating system for educational purposes with the goal of making a clean, easily accessible, powerful, & secure operating system. Too much, too big goals I know I know...

# Development
Currently, the only platform that supports building and developing the os is linux. This has been tried on Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, pretty much any debian based linux distro should be good to go.
To develop and or run this os please execute the script under scripts to install the cross compiler used to compile and build the kernel.
Second step is to run make in the root folder to build the kernel iso
Third step is to install the qemu/bochs/Oracle Virtual Box (Whatever hypervisor/emulator you are comfortable with) to run the generated iso.
This has been tested on Bochs and Oracle Virtual Box.

# Installation
No release yet.
