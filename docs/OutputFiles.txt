## What? 

this text files describes the output files and their formats produced from the build process step by step.

## bootloader

the bootloader in boot directory contains all assembly files required to build the bootloader. nasm is used for this task.
the main file bootloader.asm contains all required files and is the main entry to the bootloader. inside this file, other files are
imported that holds other functionalities. separation is good.
the bootloader does the following:
- setup the registers
- reads the PVD
- locates the kernel through the PVD
- loads the kernel at 0x0000:0x9000
- enables the A20 line
- setup GDT
- enables protected mode 
- Jmps to kernel

the output of this module is a binary file named bootloader.bin

## kernel

for now, this is just one cpp file.

the output of this module is the KERNEL.IMG binary file.
